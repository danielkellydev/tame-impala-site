        <p>Tame Impala’s origins begin in the late 1990s in Perth, Australia. Founded in 1999 as a <br>
        collaboration amongst friends, Parker and his childhood cohorts created psychedelic tracks <br>
        at home that blatantly and proudly wore their influences on their groovy sleeves – hear Nazz, <br>
        Syd Barrett’s Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, etc. However, in a short time, Parker took near-complete <br>
        control of the group, routinely playing all the instruments on the recordings but employing his <br>
        friends to join him as a live performing band.</p>
